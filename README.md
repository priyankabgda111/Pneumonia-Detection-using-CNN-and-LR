# Pneumonia-Detection-using-CNN-and-LR
**CNN based Pneumonia detection model using Chest X-ray images and Symptoms data**

This model distinguishes pneumonia using the patientâ€™s chest X-ray images and symptoms. We have worked on the real-time dataset, with the assistance of few radiologists.  So, we trust that this innovation can make strides in healthcare conveyance in parts of the world where to get talented radiologists is restricted. 

The accuracy of the model is 96% by taking both chest x-rays and symptoms as input,
 whereas ,if we take only chest x-ray images,the accuracy is around 93%.
